Creating a cube in your Unity project is just like creating any other object in Unity. 
Placing a cube in front of the user is easy because Unity's coordinate system is mapped to the real world - 
where one meter in Unity is approximately one meter in the real world.
Instructions
  In the top left corner of the Hierarchy panel, select the Create dropdown and choose 3D Object > Cube.
  Select the newly created Cube in the Hierarchy panel
  In the Inspector find the Transform component and change Position to (X: 0, Y: 0, Z: 2). 
      This positions the cube 2 meters in front of the user's starting position.
  In the Transform component, change Rotation to (X: 45, Y: 45, Z: 45) and change Scale to (X: 0.25, Y: 0.25, Z: 0.25). 
      This scales the cube to 0.25 meters.
  To save the scene changes, select File > Save Scene and push or upload files to the repo.
