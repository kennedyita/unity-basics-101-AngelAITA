This is the folder that holds all assets you import from digital content creation tools such as Maya, Max Cinema 4D or Photoshop, all code you create with Visual Studio or your favorite code editor, and any number of content files that Unity creates as you compose scenes, animations and other Unity asset types in the editor.
